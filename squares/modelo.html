                    <p>The GLORIOUS Model O  is a lightweight wireless gaming mouse produced with the GLORIOUS Forge program. It means to buy this mouse from GLORIOUS, you were required to pre-order it before production began, and it was produced in limited numbers. The pre-order phase is now over, so if you're interested in buying this mouse, you'll need to buy it from a third-party reseller. This mouse shares the same shape and dimensions as the GLORIOUS Model O Wireless, but it's lighter, lacks RGB lighting, and has a solid plastic body instead of a body with honeycomb-shaped cutouts. It also has a slightly longer advertised battery life compared to the GLORIOUS Model O Wireless. However, the sensor model and switches remain unchanged.

                        The GLORIOUS Model O is a lightweight, wireless gaming mouse. This mouse marks a departure for GLORIOUS as it's their first mouse release that doesn't feature honeycomb-shaped cutouts in the body or RGB lighting. It has the same shape and shares many of the key internal components as the GLORIOUS Model O Wireless; however, it's lighter, it has slightly longer battery life, and its solid plastic body has a textured surface. This mouse is also noteworthy for using a group buy model, meaning you needed to pre-order this mouse, and it was only produced in limited numbers. This group buy phase is over, so if you're interested in purchasing this mouse, you'll need to do so through third-party resellers.

                        <p>The Glorious Model O is one of the most anticipated gaming mice this year.  In this review we find out if this is actually the best gaming mouse of 2019 and given its price, figure out if the Glorious PC Gaming Race has also created the best budget gaming mouse as well.  But be warned, while this is an amazing mouse, it isn't for everyone But one thing that is very nice about this mosue is that it can do multiple types of clicking types such as butterfly clicking with double click and drag clicking. These methods are msotr efficienct ion this mouse.
